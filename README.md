## Installation
If you wish to set up for this project from the command line, use npm i to install dependencies. This is required in both the client and server folders.
```
npm i
```
## Usage
Once installation of dependencies is complete, you will need to run 'npm run start' in the terminal, and the application will open using localhost:3000
```
npm run start
```
Alternatively, this application is deployed to GitHub Pages, which makes it easy to simply view the project in the browser.
## Contributing
To contribute to the project, simply perform a git clone of the repository. For any changes made, a pull request is required, and I will determine whether to merge the changes or not.
